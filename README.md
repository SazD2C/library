# library
This is a project founded by SALT, designed to bring teaching materials to the public.

#Details

The `lessons` folder is where the lessons are stored on server. They should be put where the web server can reach the files, for example our path was `C:\Apache24\htdocs\lessons`. The url should look like `http://webhost/lessons`, if you have anything different you'll have to modify the pathing in the code.
